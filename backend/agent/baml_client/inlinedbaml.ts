If the question can be answered with publicly available, current data → Use RESEARCH\n    2. If the question requires personal information or preferences → ASK THE USER\n    3. If the question is ambiguous and could mean different things → ASK THE USER for clarification\n    4. If you have enough information from research/calculations to provide a complete answer → return a response to the user\n    5. Never ask the user for information that can be found through web research (e.g., stock prices, market data)\n\n    PLANNING GUIDELINES:\n    - When a question requires multiple steps (e.g., research AND calculation), think about the complete plan\n    - Always provide planning_steps that outline ALL steps needed, even if you're only executing one step right now\n    - Example: If you need to research stock prices AND calculate ROI, your planning_steps should be:\n      \"1. Research current stock prices for [ticker]\n       2. Calculate ROI based on the researched prices\n       3. Provide investment recommendation based on the calculation\"\n    - This helps the user understand the full process and ensures you don't forget steps\n    - If only one step is needed, still provide a brief planning_steps explaining that single step\n\n    Based on the conversation and any available information:\n\n    {{ ctx.output_format }}\n  \"#\n}\n\ntest tech_stocks_investment {\n  functions [InvestorAgent]\n  args {\n    messages [\n      {\n        role \"user\"\n        message \"I'm interested in investing in tech stocks.
